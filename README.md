# IMDB Review Sentiment Analysis

## Project Description
The AI IMDb Review Analysis project is a machine learning application that performs sentiment analysis on IMDb movie reviews. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify reviews as positive or negative. It includes a user-friendly web interface built with Flask, enabling users to upload reviews and see real-time sentiment predictions.

## Features
- Sentiment Analysis using Logistic Regression
- Preprocessing pipeline for text normalization
- Web-based interface built with Flask
- Model and vectorizer persistence with joblib
